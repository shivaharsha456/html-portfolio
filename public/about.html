<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Master of Science in Information Technology student at the University of Cincinnati, I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I have a strong background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, with a Bachelor of Technology degree from Anurag Group of Institutions.</p>

<p>Recently, I completed a three-month internship as a Full Stack Developer at Skill secure IT solutions, where I developed and deployed web applications using Node.js, jQuery, and Embedded JavaScript (EJS). I also gained valuable experience in cloud computing, as I obtained a certification from Udemy and used it to implement and manage cloud services for the applications. I am proud of the positive feedback I received from the clients and the mentors, as well as the skills and knowledge I acquired during the internship.

<p>My core competencies include web development, cloud computing, and database management. I am proficient in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, and Git. I am also eager to learn new skills and explore new domains, such as artificial intelligence, data science, and cybersecurity.

<p>My goal is to become a successful and innovative IT professional, who can contribute to the advancement and improvement of the field. I am looking for opportunities to work on challenging and meaningful projects, collaborate with diverse and talented teams, and grow as a developer and a leader. I am here to have new experiences, meet new people, and learn new things.</p>
